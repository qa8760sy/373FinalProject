                restore more wound points than the character's full normal total.<br>
                Surgery takes time; it requires 1 hour per wound point lost to perform surgery on a paitent.

                The result of the check detrmines the number of wound points restored. A character who has his 
                wounds healed through surgery is fatigued for a number of hours equal to the number of wound 
                points restored.

                disposal. A blaster might run out of power, and a lightsaber might sputter and die if not

                their evolution. rarely taught to outsiders and often particular to the species' unique 
                physiology. Some styles, especially the more recently invented ones, are created through the 
                sharing of talent and philosophies from the far reaches of the galaxy. Regardless of their 
                origins, martial arts forms are strict disciplines with deadly potential. The forms are

                            Kasi masters learned the style by journeying to Bunduki to learn form these 
                            keepers. The name Teras Kasi actually means "steel hands," referring to the damage 
                            and toughness of the martial artist's unarmed attacks. The style focuses on power

                            applied to the attacks. The style is unique, and masters are few and far between.
