                Use this skill to estimate the value of an object, from an old
                blaster Lo an Alderaanian heirloom.<br>
                <b>Check: </b>You can appraise common or well-known objects within 10% of their value (DC 12). 
                Failure means you estimate the value al 50% to 150% of actual value. The GM secretly rolls 2d6
                +3. multiplies by 10%, multiplies the actual value by that percentage, and tells you what you 
                think the value of the item is. ( For a common or well known item. your chance of estimating 
                the value within 10% is fairly high, even if you fail the check-in such a case, considcr it a 
                lucky guess.)<br>
                For example, a beat-up droid is offered for sale by a Jawa trader and you want to determine 
                the droid's approximate value before getting into a haggling session. If you fail the check 
                (which the GM might decide to make in secret for you so you don't know), the GM rolls 2d6+3 
                and gets a result of 12. She multiplies this by 10% for a result of 120%. The actual value of 
                the old droid is 2,000 cedits. Multiplying 2,000 by 120%, the GM tells you thal you gauge the 
                value of the droid to he about 2.400 credits. Since you failed the check, you believe that the 
                droid is worth more than it actually is.<br>
                Rare or exotic items require a check against DC 15. 20, or 130% of its actual value. The GM 
                secretly rolls 2d4 + 5, higher. If successful, you estimate the value at 70% to percentage, 
                and tells you what you believe the value of that multiplies by 10%, multiplies the actual 
                value by that The result of an Appraise check should have an effect on item is. Failure means 
                you can't estimate the Item's value. might end up making some extra money off you. On the the 
                story, as in the case of the Jawa trader above, who determine that the offer a starship dealer 
                gives you is just other hand, with a successful Appraise check, you might
                <b>Retry: </b>Not on the same object, regardle!u of success.
                too good to pass up.<br>
                Special: When making the check untrained. for common items failure means you make no estimate 
                (you can take a wild guess if you want), and for rare items success means an estimate of 50% 
                to 150% (2d6 + 3 times 10%).<br>

                Use this skill to plot a course through hyperspace from one star system to another.<br>
                <b>Check: </b>You can plot a safe course through hyperspace between two star systems. The 
                result of an Astrogate check determines whether a particular trip occurs without incident and 
                how much time the trip takes; a failed check indicates either a delayed journey or the 
                possibility of a hyperspace mishap that can ruin the journey. For information on moving 
                through hyperspace, see Astrogation on page 205 in Chapter Eleven: Starships.<br>
                You can also use this skill to determine your position in space without the use of a nav

            <div id="bluff"><h4>Bluff (Cha)</h4><br>
                You can make the outrageous or the untrue seem plausible. The skill encompasses conning, 
                fast-talking. misdirection. prevarication, and misleading through body language. Use a bluff 
                to sow temporary confusion. get someone to turn his head in the direction you point, or simply 
                to look innocuous.<br>
                <b>Check: </b>A Bluff check is opposed by the targets Sense Motive check. Favorable and 
                unfavorable circumstances. weigh heavily on the outcome of a bluff. Two circumstances can 
                weigh against you: The bluff is hard to believe. or the action that the bluff requires the 
                target to take goes against the target's self-interest, nature, personality, or orders.<br>
                If it's important, the GM can distinguish between a bluff that fails because the target 
                doesn't believe it and one that fails because it just asks too much of the target. For 
                instance, if the target gets a + 10 bonus because the bluff demands something risky of the 
                target, and the target's Sense Motive check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target didn't so 
                much see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go along with it. lf the target's Sense 
                Motive check succeeds by 11 or more, he has seen through the bluff (and would have done so 
                even if it had not placed any demand of him).<br>

                A successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as you wish. at least for a short 
                time (usually 1 round or less). or the target believes something that you want him to believe. 
                For example, you could use a bluff to put someone off guard by telling him someone was behind 
                him. At best, such a bluff would make the target glance over his shoulder. lt would not cause 
                the target to ignore you and completely turn around.<br>
                A bluff requires interaction between the character and the target. Targets unaware of the 
                character can't be bluffed.<br>

                can't dodge yourattack effectively. lf you succeed, the next attack you make against the 
                targetignores his Dexterity bonus to Defense(if any), thus lowering the Defensescore. Feinting 
                in this way against atarget of a different species from youdifficult because it's harder to 
                read analien's body language; you take a -4penalty. Against a creature or animalIntelligence ( 
                     1 or 2) it's even harder:you take a -8 penalty. Against a non-intelligentcreature. it's 
                impossible.
                <i>Creating a Diversion to Hide: </i>You can use Bluff to help you hide. A successful Bluff 
                check gives you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are 
                aware of you.
                <i>Seduction: </i>You cna us ea Bluff to convince members of the opposeite sex to believe that 
                your romantic intentions are cincere (assuming that they aren't). You make a Bluff check 
                opposed by the target's Sense Motive. A success allows you to persuade him other to do a small 
                favor for you, such as looking the other way when you do something suspicious, or prodviding 
                you wiht information that is meant to be secret. This form of seduction is only temporary; 
                this us of Bluff is not the way to another peron's heart. It only ensures their complitety for 
                a short time.<br>
                This aciton cannot be performed during combat.
                <i>Sending a Secret Message: </i>You can use Bluff to send and understand secret messages 
                while seemingly speaking about other topics. Two Bothan spies might suspect that their comlink 
                channels are being monitored. for example, and decide to pass along information about their 
                mission while appearing to be discussing the price of grains from Agamar. Passing along a 
                basic message ("Meet me at noon in the usual place") has a DC of 10. Complex messages ("Bring 
                your blaster pistol. but only if you think you can get here without being searched") or 
                messages trying to communicate new information ("Meet me an hour earlier than usual, in the 
                tapcafe down the street from the usual place") have DCs of 15 or 20. Both the sender and the 
                receiver must make the check for the secrrt message to be successfully relayed and understood.
                <br>
                Anyone listening in on a secret message can attempt a Sense Motive check (DC equal to the 
                sender's Bluff check result). If successful, the eavesdropper realizes that a secret message 
                is contained in the communication. If the eavesdropper beats the DC by 5 or more, he 
                understands the secret message. <br>
                Whether trying to send or intercept a message, a failure by 5 or more points means that one 
                side or the other misinterprets the message in some fashion. The GM should always roll such 
                Bluff checks in secret. lf the message is being communicated from one hero to another, the 
                sender should write the message down and give it to the GM, who in turn makes the secret Bluff 
                check, then copies the note and hands the copy to the intended recipient<br>
                <b>Retry: </b>Generally, a failed Bluff check makes the target too suspicious for you to try 
                another bluff in the same circumstances. For feinting in combat, you may retry freely. <br>
                <b>Special: </b>You can take 10 when making a bluff (except for feinting in combat). but you 
                can't take 20.<br> A character with the Trick feat gets a +2 aptitude bonus on Bluff checks 
                <br>
                <b>Time: </b> Abluff takes al least 1 round (and is at least  a full-round action) but can 
                take much longer if you try something elaborate.<br> using Bluff as a feint in combat is an 
                attack action.<br>

                <i>Armor Check Penalty</i><br>
                Use this skill to scale a cliff, to get to a window on the second story of a building, or to 
                climb up an antenna array after falling out of an airway at the bottom o a floating city.<br>
                <b>Check: </b>With each successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope or 
                a wall or other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds).<br> A slope is considered to 
                be any incline of less than 60 degrees: a wall is any incline of 60 degrees or steeper. A 
                failed Climb check indicates that you make no progress, and a check that fails by S or more 
                means that you fall from
                wha1evcr height you have already attained.<br>
                The DC or the check depends on the conditions of
                The climb.<br>
                Since you can't move to avoid an attack while climbing, opponents get a +2 bonus on attack 
                rolls against you, and you lose any Dexterity bonus to Defense.<br>
                Any time you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check against he DC of hte slope or 
                wall. Failure means you fall for your current ehight and sustain the appropriat3e falling 
                damage. (See Falling Damage)<br>
                <i>Acelerated Climbing: </i> You try to climb more quickly tahn nomral, attempting to cover 
                your full speed in climbing distance, but take -5 penalty on climb checks.<br>
                <i>Making Handhols and Footholds:</i> You can make your own handhols and footholds by pounding 
                pitons into a wall. Doing so takes 1 minute per piton, and one piton is needed per meter. As 
                with any surface with handhold, and
                footholds. a wall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In the
                same way, a climber with an ice axe or similar implement
                can cut handholds or footholds in an ice wall.
                <i>Catching ourself when falling: </i> It's practically impossible
                to catch yourself on a wall while falling. Make a Climb
                check (DC = wall's DC + 20) to do so. A slope is relatively
                easier to catch yourself on (DC = slope's DC+ 10).
                <i>Grab My Arm</i>You can catch someone who is falling past you. If you can make a melee touch 
                attack against someone falling within your reach, you may then attempt to CLimb check (DC = 
                wall's DC + 10 )to prevent that person's fall. (The DC for catching someone falling on a slope 
                is hte slope's DC + 5.) If you fail the Climb check, you fail to stop the person's fall. If 
                you fail by 5 or more you, fall as well. The person's total weight (including equipment) 
                cannot exceed your heavy load, or you automatically fall.

               Use this skill to access computer systems and write or
               modify computer programs, to reprogram droids, and to
               override or bypass computer-controlled devices.<br>
                <b>Check: </b>Most normal computer operations (such as running a program) don't require a 
                skill check. However, conducting a complex. search through numerous databases, writing 
                computer programs to make complex calculations or manipulate data in specific ways, altering 
                existing programs to perform differently (better or worse). and braking through computer 
                security are all relatively difficult and require skill checks.<br>
                <i>Conduct Complex Search: </i>Researching a topic on the HoloNet (or its equivalent in 
                different eras) with a combination of search engines and a lot of site hits takes time, skill, 
                and some luck. The GM determines how obscure a particular topic is (the more obscure, the 
                higher the DC) and what kind of information might be available. In some cases, the GM might 
                require that the character must break into a secure site before conducting a search to obtain 
                certain kinds or informa1ion.<br>
                Information ranges from general to protected. For example. locating general information about 
                a senator is easier than gathering specific Information (such as the senator's date of birth), 
                which is easier than finding restricted information (such as the senator's private comm 
                channel code), which is easier than uncovering protected information (such as the senator's 
                cred stick code).

               <i>Shipboard Security: </i> A ship's internal security systems are capable of opening or shutting doors, activating or deactivating alarms, and so on. On most smaller ships, these functions are handheld from the bridge or cockpit, although larger shihps have dedicated security stations. Operating security systems from a designated post is easy (Computer Use, DC 10). Accessing them from other ternimals on the ship may be possible, but it's also more difficult (Computer Use DC 20). If two different characters are attempting to control security systems, they must make opposed Computer Use checks; anyone using a security station gains a +5 bonus.<br>
               <i>Communications: </i>Day-to-day communications tasks (hailing a nerby ship, using a subspace tranciever, accessing a hypertransciever, contacting an indidivual comlink, and so on) are accomplished iwtha Computer Use check (DC 10). HoloNet transcievers are much more comlicated devices, requiring a Computer Use check (DC 15) to accomplish these sazme tasks (although their effective range is unlimited).<br>
               <i>Scramble Communications: </i>Computer use can be used to establish scrambled communications. This is done with opposed Computer Use checks between the person sending the message and anyone attempting to intercept or unscramble it. The Superior quality of hpyertransciever gives a +2 circumstance bonus on such checks; a HoloNet transciever gives a +4 circumstance bonus.<br>
               <i>Cover Tracks: </i>A slicer illegally accessing a computer system can conceal his involvement by altering hte system's usage records. By making a Computer Use check (DC 20), you can alter your own identifying information. This imposes a -5 penalty on any attempt made to identify you should your activities be deteced, even after the fact.<br>
               <i>Clarification on Gaining Access: </i>Though much slicing is performed via the HoloNet or similar communications network, not all computer systmes throughout the galaxy are linked to the communications network at large. THose seeking access to a given computer system have two options: physical and remote access.<br>
               Physical access requires a comptuer interace (generally a monitor and some sort of control system, such as a keyboard) phyiscally attached to the system. In some cases, the comptuer interface is already on site. Accessing the system in this way oculd require a Bluff or Disable Device checks to gain entry, Repiar or Disable Device checks to work on the network junciton, and a variety of other skills, befor ethe fist Computer use check ont he system can be attempted.<br>
               Remote access requires two Computer Use checks. The first check (DC 10) is needed to lcoate the site on the network the second is a check to break computer security (as outlined int eh Comptuer use skill). Once you've succeeded with both checks, you've accessed the site and may beign conducting searches, writing or altering programs, or operating associated remotes.<br>
               <i>Break Computer Security: </i>Also called "slicing," this application of Computer Use can't be used untrained. ln cases where the other user is actively combating the slicer's efforts, a slicer has to beat an opposing computer user's check result. In generall, though, the DC is determined by the quality of thr security program installed 10 defend the system. If the check fails by 10 or more, the security system immediately alerts it's administrator that there has been an unauthorized entry.

               <br>
               Before you can use a Craft skill, you must purchase a set
               of basic tools. The cost of these tools varies according to
               the complexity or the item you want to build (see the
               accompanying table). The tools to make an item of a
               certain complexity can also be used to make any item of lower complexity. To upgrade your basic tools and thus be able to make items of higher complexity, you only need to spend the difference in cost between the tools you have and the tols you are acquiring. For exmaple, if oyu spend 150 credits on basic tools to make items of high complexity, you can also make items of medium or low complexity using those smae tools. If you later decide you want to make items of extreme complexity, you must spend another 850 credits (1,000 minus 150) to acquire the necessary tools.<br>
               Having the idea tools fo rhte job creates a condiiton of favorable circumstances, giving youa  +2 circumstance bonus on all your Craft checks. The cost to acquire ideal tools for items of a certain complexity is 10 times the cost of the basic tools. For exmaple, the cost of idea tools to make itmes of high complexity is 1,500 credits
               <b>Check: </b>The basic function of the Craft skill is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The price of the tiem and your check results dtermine how long it takes to make the time. The itme's price also dtermines the cost of raw materials (the parts and components necessary to build the item).<br>
               To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item:
               <ol>
                    <li>Find the item's price in Equipment, or have GM set hte price of an item not listed.</li>
                    <li>Pay one-third the tiem's price in raw materials.</li>
                    <li>Make a skill check that represents one day's work.</li>
               </ol>
               Multiply the check result by your skill modifier (your skill
               ranks your Intelligence modifier + miscellaneous modifier;).
               If that number equals or exceeds the item's price,
               then you have completed the item.<br>
               It your check result x your skill modifier is less than the
               item's price, then that number represents progress you've
               maide this day toward completing the item. Subtract the
               amount of progress from the item's price and record the
               new reduced value. At the end or the next day or work,
               make another check. Each day. you make more progress
               until the day when your check result x your skill modifier
               equals or exceeds the item's remaining value. At that point,
               you havf completed the item.<br>
               You can hand an unfinished item over to someone else to
               complete, or, if the item is sufficiently large, multiple craftmen
               can work on the item simultaneously. In either case, use the total results of all the Craft checks applied ot the tiem to determine when the item is finished.<br>
               Upon the item's complelion, make another Craft check tO
               determine whether the item actually functions as intended.
               If you fail the check, subtract 10% of the item's full price
               from !he Craft results that have been applied. If the resulting
               number is still high enough for the item to be finished,
               then the item functions normally. If not, the item merely
               looks finished, but is not. The craftsman can elect either to
               spend more time to finish the project (by making more day-by-
               day Craft checks) or to pass the item off as fully
               functional. The user of an unfinished or defective item takes
               a -2 penalty on skill checks, attack rolls, or saving throws
               made when the performance of the item is tested-when a
               weapon is wielded in combat, when a vehicle is piloted or
               driven, when armor is subjected to an attack, and so forth.<br>
               If you Fail this final check by 5 or more, you ruin half the
               raw materials and have to pay half the original raw-material
               cost again.<br>

                <b>Example: </b>Kaz decides that he will construct a comlink
                for his friend Spin. The price of a comlink is 2OO credits so
                he pays 67 credits for the components: an energy cell, a
                circuit board, a power switch, some diodes. magnets. and a
                housing. he then makes his f1rst Craft (electronic devices)
                check. His skill modifier is +8, and he rolls a 14, for a total
                of 22. Kaz then multiplies 22 (his result) times 8 (his skill
                modifier), for a total of 176. The comlink is mostly finished
                but Kaz will need at least one more day.<br>
                Unfortunately, Kaz is injured on the morning of the
                second day, and must rest rather than work. Spin decides to
                take over, because he needs the comlink in a hurry. Spin
                uses Craft (eleclronic devices) untrained. since he has no
                ranks. though he has an Intelligence modifier of +2. He rolls
                his Craft check and gets a 16, for a total of 18. Spin multiples
                18 by 2, for a total of 36. With Kaz's 176, that's
                212-more than enough to complete the comlink.<br>
                Now comes the tricky part. Kaz recovers and checks Spin's
                work on the comlink. thus making the final skill check to
                make sure that the comlink functions properly. The
                complexity of a nonencrypted comlink is medium, so Kaz
                has to beat a DC of 10 on this check. But Kaz rolls a 1, for a
                total of 9-not enough! The GM now deducts 10% of the
                comlink's cost (20) from the total of the Craft results (212),
                for a result of 192.<br>
                Kaz now has the option of spending another day working
                on the comlink or passing it off as "finished." Kaz cannily
                opts For the latter, and gives Spin his new comlink. Because
                there is no check or roll involved wilh using a comlink.
                though, the -2. penalty doesn't apply; instead, the GM
                decides that the comlink will occasionally cut out in the
                middle of a convesation.
                <b>Retry: </b>For lhe final check in constructing an item, yes.
                but each time you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the
                raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material
                cost again. You may not retry a roll on the daily
                progress check. <br>
                <b>Special: </b>You can take 10 on a Craft skill check, but you can't take 20. <br>
                <b>Time: </b>Craft checks are made by the day, as descirbed above.<br>

To create a textbook starship (one with a hyperdrive and weapons), would you need to make separate Craft (hyperdrives), Craft (starship weapons) and Craft (starship of choice) attempts, or would the starship craft entail all that (the hyperdrive and weapons being included in the raw materials)?</div><br>

               result for the    hgihest DC that's equal to or less than the check result. For example, a 
               result of 19 produces a  blast that does double damage and provides a -2 penalty to the Reflex 
               save of anyone caught in the   blast area. A failed check (a result of 9 or lower) reduces the 
               explosvie power by half, proivdes a   +4 circumstance bonus on Reflex svaes to avoid damage, 
               and has a 15% chance of causing the device to  explode prematurely. This application of the

                 When using Diplomacy to haggle a price, each side makes a Diplomacy check. For every 5 points that you beat your opoonent's check result by, you can adjust th sale price by 5% up or down (your choice) from the market value (from Equipment or established by the Gamemaster). A GM character almost always agrees to teh new price, but a player's character is never required to buy or sell at a specific, even if he or she fails the opposed Diplomacy check.<br>
                 <i>A nNote on Haggling: </i>The prices for standard items given in Equipment represent the result of a reasonable negotiation. You hsoulnd't haggle over mundane items. you should only haggle over prices when it's signficant to the mission-if you're arguing over the price of every meal, your GM can and should ask you to move on to more interesting things.<br>
               <b>Retry: </b>Generally, retires don't work. Even if the initial checks ucceeds, the other character can only be persuaded so far, and a retry may do more harm than good. If the intial check fails, the other character has probably become more firmly committed to his position, and a retry is futile. <br>
               <b>Special: </b>Charisma checks to influence Gm charactesr are gnerally untrained Diplomacy checks.<br>
               You can take 10 when making a Dpilomacy check, but you can't take 20.<br>
               A character with the Trustworthy Feat gets a +2 aptitude bonus on Diplomacy checks.
               <b>Time: </b>Diplomacy is at least a full-round action. The GM may determine that some negotiations require a longer preriod of time. <br>

               Use this skillt o disamr a security device, defeat a mechianical lock or trap, or rig a device 
               to fail when it is used. You can examine a simple or fairly small mechanical or electronic 
               device and disable it. The effort requires at least a simple tool of the appropriate sort (a 
               pick, electronic lead, wire, file, pry bar, hydrospanner, and so on).<br>
               <b>Check: </b>The GM makes the Disable Device check so that you don't necessarily know whether 
               you've succeeded. The DC for the check depends on how tricky the device is.<br>
               Disabling (or rigging or hjamming) a simple mechanical device has a DC of 10. More intricate 
               and complex devices (particularly those that are electronic) have a higher DC. The Gm rolls the 
               check. If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If the check fails by 4 or less, you have 
               faile dbut can try again. if you fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. if it's a trap, you 
               spring it. If it's some sort of sabotage, you think the device is disbaled, but it still works 
               normally.<br>
               <i>Disarm Explosive Device: </i> A character can use the Disbale Device skill to attempt to 
               disarm a set explosive. The DC is 10 for a simple explosive device, 15 for a moderate explosive 
               device, 20 for a complex explosive device, and so on. If the builder was successful in adding a 
               trap, increase the DC by +10, +15, or +20.

                    the GM can make one Spot check per hour for the people the character encounters. The GM 
                    uses a + 1 modifier on the check to represent the average of the crowd (most people with

                    <i>Ropes: </i>Your Escape Artist check is opposed by your opponent's Dexterity check used 
                    to tie the bonds. Since it's easier to tie someone up than to escape from being tied up, 
                    the opponent gets a special + 10 bonus on her check. <br>
                    <i>Net: </i>Getting out of the tangle of a new is tricky. <br>
                    <i>Binders and Manacles: </i>These confine wrists aor ankles and may be secured to 
                    stationary obecjts.<br>
                    <i>Tight Space: </i>This is the DC for getting through a space where one's head fits but 
                    one's shoulders don't. If the space is long, such as in the air shaft, the GM may call for 
                    multiple checks. You can't fit through a space that your head doesn't fit through.<br>
                    <i>Grappler: </i>You can make an Escape Artist check opposed by your opponent's grapple 
                    check to get out of the grapple or out of a pinned condition (so that you're just being 
                    grappled). Doing so is an attack action, so if you escape the grapple you can move in the 
                    same round. See Grappling in Combat.<br>
                    <i>Retrieve: </i> You can retrieve objects from tight spaces. As with moving through such 
                    spaces yourself, you may attempt an Escape Artist check (DC 30) to reach into a space 
                    where your hand fits, but your arm ordinarily doesn't. Obviously, the maximum distance you 
                    can reach into a tight space in this fashion is limited by the length of your appendage 
                    (about 1 meter for most Medium-size creatures). If the object is physically incapable of 
                    passing through the opening, your attempt automatically fails.<br>

                    additional checks as long as you're not being actively opposed. <br>
                    <b>Special: </b>You can take 10 on an Escape Artist check. You can take 20 if you're not 
                    being actively opposed. <br>

                    <b>Time: </b>Making a check to escape from being bound by ropes, manacles, or other 
                    restraints (except a grappler) requires 1 minute of work. Escaping a net is a full-round 
                    action. Squeezing through a tight space takes at least 1 minute. maybe longer, depending 
                    on the distance that must be crossed. <br>

               General information concerns local happenings, rumors, gossip, and the like. Specific information usually relates to a specific question. such as "which way to Mos Espa?" or "What can you tell me about the mysterious woman who always stands behind the senator?" Restricted information Includes facts that aren't generally known and requires that you locate someone who has access to such information. Protected information is even harder to come by and might include some danger, either to the one asking the questions or the one providing the answer. In the case of both restricted and protected information, there's a chance that someone will take note of anyone asking about information that falls into one of these categories.<br> You can also increase the amount of credits you use to gather information, gaining a circumstance bonus by effectively offering a bribe (though the process might entail buying more expensive drinks, not necessarily offering a character extra credits). Pay one-half of the cost for each + 1 cirrnmstance bonus you want to add 10 your check. For example, Deel Surool is looking  restricted information about a star system that doesn't appear on any public astrogation charts. He really wants to get this information so he spends 250 credits, plus an additional 125 credits for every + 1 bonus he wants to apply to the check. In this case he can afford an additional 250 credits, granting him a +l bonus on the check.<br>
               <i>Chain of Command: </i>You can get a broad overview  of the command structure of an organization: who the officers or leaders are; how many layers of command exist between the highest-level officers and the average footsoldier (or entry-level operative); how to identify ranks within the organization; and what kind of authority the various ranks have. Discovering the names of specific members of the organization adds + 10 to the DC of the Gather Information check, and acquiring their locations adds another +5.<br>
               The more secretive the organization, the more difficult this information is to obtain. Publicly recognized organizations are much easier to learn about than organizations that officially don't exist at all. You can only obtain this information if someone in the community actually knows it. At the GM's discretion, the local community may be completely ignorant of an organization operating in their area. (If a pirate crew is using the remote and long-abandoned monastery a thousand kilometers away, and no one outside the organization knows they are there, the average citizen can't provide any information about their command structure.)<br>

               <i>Teach an Animal Tasks: </i>With this skill, you can teach a domestic animal a few tricks. 
               You can train on type of animal per rank (specified when th ranks are purchased) to obey 
               commands and perform simple tricks. You an work with up to three animals of the same type at 
               one time, and can teach them general tasks such as guarding, attacking, carrying riders, 
               performing heavy labor, hunting and tracking, or fighting beside troops. An animal can be 
               trained for one gereral purpose only.<br>
               <i>Teach an Animal Unuaul Tasks: </i>This use of the skill is similar to teaching an animal 
               tasks, except that the tasks can be something unusual for that breed of anima, such as training 
               a bantha to be a war mount, Alternatively, you can use this aspect of Handle Animal to train an 
               animal to perform specialized tricks, such as teaching a ronto to rear on command or to come 
               when whistled for, or teaching a falocn to pluck objects from someone's grasp.<br>
               <i>rear a Wild or Deadly Animal: </i>Rearing a wild or deadly animal invovles raising aw ild 
               creature from infancy so that it is domesticated. The creature's level (see chapter Four allies 
               and opponents of the Core book) is added to the DC. A handler can rear up tot three creatures 
               of the same type at once a succesfully domesticated wild or deadly animal can be taught tricks 
               at the same time that its being raised, or can be taught hem as domesticated animal later.<br>
               <i>Train a Wild or Deadly Animal: </i>The character can train a wild or deadly creature to do 
               certaint ricks, but only at the character's command. The creature is still wild, though usually 
               controllable. Add the creature's level to the DC.<br>
               <i>Organic Technology: </i>You cna operate organic technology, such as that utilized by the 
               Yuuzhan Vong. Handle Animal check, in this application, allows you to immediately grasp not 
               only the function of organic tools, but to quickly work out how to operate them with a prior 
               demonstration. The basic DC for most such attempts is onl 10, but the GM may rule that more 
               complex organisms call for a higher DC.<br>

               <i>Armor Check Penalty</i>
               Use this skill to sink back into the shadows and proceed unseen, approach an Imperial guard

               Coruscant without being noticed.<br>
               <b>Check: </b>Your Hide check is opposed by the Spot check of anyone who might see you. You can 
               move up to one-half your normal speed and hide at no penalty. At more than one-half and up to 
               your full speed you take a -5 penalty, It's practically impossible (-20 penalty) to hide while 
               running or charging.<br>
               for exmaple. Deel Surool has a speed of 10 meters. If he doesn't want to take a penalty on his 
               Hide check, he can move 5 meters as a move action in the same round when he  is trying tn hide.

               If people are observing you, even casually. you can't hide. You can run around a corner so that 
               you're out of sight and then hide. but the others then know at least where you went.<br>
               <i>Creating a Diversion to Hide: </i>You can use the Bluff skill (see Bluff) to help you hide. 
               A successful Bluff check can give you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check 
               while people are aware fo you. While the others turn their attention from you. You can make a 
               Hide check if you can get to a hiding place of some kind. (As a general guidline, the hiding 
               place has to be within 1 meter for every 3 ranks you have in Hide.) This check, however, is at 
               a -10 penalty because you have to move fast.<br>
               <i>Conceal: </i>You can conceal an item in a location where it can·t be easily found. Your Hide 
               check result is opposed by the Search checks of anyone looking for the item, or otherwise 
               searching in the area in question. The GM makes the Hide ched. for you secretly, so that you're 
               not sure how well the object is concealed. (This is not the same as disguising an object as 
               something else. which is an application of the Disguise skill, or hiding an item on your 
               person, which is an application of the Sleight of Hand skill.) <br>
               <i>Tailing: </i>You can use the Hide skill to avoid notice as you are following someone else. 
               When tailing someone, you make a Hide check opposed by their Spot check whenever the target 
               changes direction or stops. If the target's Spot check equals or exceeds your Hide check, they 
               become aware of you. A target aware of being tailed has the option of trying to lose the 
               pursuer, or perhaps to lure the pursuer into a trap.<br>
               To lose the pursuer, the target can attempt a Hide check opposed by the pursuer's Spot check. 
               If the target's Hide check exceeds the pursuer's Spot check, the pursuer has lost track of the 
               target. (The pursuer can scan the area in hopes of reestablishing pursuit. however-or simply go 
               to where he believes he can locate the target again.)<br>
               To lure the pursuer into a trap (which can be anything from an ambush to a pointless chase). 
               The target can attempt a Bluff check as an attack action, opposed by the pursuer's Sense Motive 
               check. lf the pursuer's check is higher, he realizes that the target is aware of him and is 
               attempting to mislead him, and can react accordingly. The GM should roll both checks in secret; 
               the player should not know if the Sense Motive succeeded or failed (regardless of whether his 
               character is the pursuer or the target). <br>

               Use this skill to get someone ot do something he doesn't want to do by means of verbal threats, 
               force of will, and imposing body language.<br>
               <b>Check: </b>With a successful check. you can forcibly persuade another character to perform 
               some task or behave in a certain way. The DC is typically 10 + the target's level. Any bonuses 
               that a target may have on saving throws against fear increase the DC.<br>
               There are limits to what a succcessful Intimidate check can do. You can, for example, cause an 
               adversary to back down from a confrontation, surrender one of his possessions, reveal a piece 
               of secret information, or flee from you for a short time. You can't force someone to obey your 
               every command or do something that endangers that person's life.<br>
               <i>Demoralize: </i>You can also use Intimidate to weaken an opponent's resolve in combat. To do 
               so, make an Intimidate check as a move action, opposed by the target's level check. If you beat 
               your target's result, the target character suffers a -2 penalty on attack rolls. This effect 
               lasts for 1 round. The target must be within 10 meters and able to perceive you to be 
               intimidated in this way. You cannot demoralize an unintelligent being (a being with an 
               lntelligence score of 0).<br>
               <b>Retry: </b>Generally, retried don't work. Even if the initial check succeeds, the other 
               character can only be intimidated so much, and a retry doesn't help. If the initial check 
               fails, the other character has probably become more firmly resolved to resist the intimidator, 
               and a retry is futile.<br>

               <b>Check: </b>You jump a minimum distance plus an additional distance depending on the amount 
               by which your Jump check result exceeds 10. The maximum distance of any jump is a function of 
               your height.<br> The distances given on the table below are for characters with speeds of 10 
               meters. If you have a lower speed (because of armor, encumbrance, or weight carried, for 
               instance), reduce the distance jumped proportionally.<br>
               For example, Rorworr the Wookie has a Jump skill modifier of + 3 [no ranks, + 3 Strength bonus) 
               and a base speed of 10 meters. He attempts a running jump across a 4- meter-wide chasm. and his 
               player rolls a 13 for a result of 16 ( 13 + 3 = 16). That's 6 more than 10, so he clears 2 
               meters (6 x 1/3 = 2) more than the minimum distance, or 4 meters. Rorworr just makes it.

               <i>Clarification on Overheard Conversations: </i>Hearing someone talking in a nomral voice is a DC 0 listen check. modified (like all Listen checks) by the distance from the source. Hearing a whisper is a DC 5 Listen check. In both cases, you can actually understand what is being said (assuming you understand the language) if your Listen check exceeds the DC by 10 or more.
               <b>Retry: </b>You can make a Listen check every time you have the opportunity to hear something in a reactive manner. As a full-round action, you may attempt to hear somethign that oyu failed (or believe you failed) to ehar previously. <br>
               <b>Special: </b>When several characters are listening to the same thing, the GM can make a single 1d20 roll and use it for all the listeners' skill checks. <br>
               You can take 10 or take 20 when makinga  Listen check. Taking 20 means you spend 2 minutes attempting to hear something that may or may not be there to hear.<br>

               Use this skill to operate a vehicle, whether it performs in land, sea, air, or space.<br>
               <b>Check: </b>Typical piloting tasks don't require checks. Checks are required during combat, 
               for special maneuvers, or in other extreme circumstances or when the pilot wnats to attempt 
               something outsdie the normal parameterrs of the vehicle.<br>
               As a rule of thumb, easy vehicle maneuvers-including low-speed turns and loops- do not require 
               a check; they only require movement. Stunts-actions in which the pilot or dirver attempts to do 
               something complex very quickly or in a limited space-require Pilot checks. Using a ship's 
               afterburners to increase  speed has a DC of 10, and using a braking thrusters to slow a ship 
               down rapidly has a DC of 15. Performinga  tight loop is somewhat more challenging (DC 25), and 
               the DC for avoiding hazards ranges from very easy (DC 0) to nearly impossible (DC 40).<br>
               Each vehicle's description includes a maneuver modifier that applies to all Pilot checks made 
               when operating the vehicle. (For starships, this modifier derives directly form the size fo the 
               ship.)<br>
               For descriptions of vehicle and starship maneuvers and combat, see Vehicles and Starships of 
               the core book.

               You are trained in a livelihood or professional role, such as bartender, cook, moisture farmer, 
               herbalist, spacehand, trader, doctor, slicer, engineer, mechanic, lawyer law officer, computer 
               programmer, droid provrammer, military officer, gambler or entertainer.<br>
               Like Craft and Knowledge. Profession is actually a number of separate skills. You could have 
               several profession skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill. For 
               instance, you could have the skill Profession (cook). Your ranks in that skill don't affect any 
               checks you happen to make for Profession (gambler) or Profession (moisture farmer), for exmaple.
               <br>
               While a Craft skill represents skill in creating an item, a Profession skill represnts the 
               ability to deal with the business aspects of a chosen vocation. If your job produces a tangible 
               product or fits into the manufacturing sector, then it's represneted by a Craft skill. If your 
               job provides a service, it's reprented by a Profession skill. 
               <b>Check: </b>You can practice your profession and make a decent living, earning your check 
               result times 100 in credits for one week of dedicated for(this is under normal conditions and 
               in a location where the work is needed). So, a check result of 22 would earn you 2,200 credits 
               during the upcoming week.<br>
               You know how  to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the profession's daily tasks, how 
               to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems.  For example a spacehand 
               knows how to perform basic starship maintenance and the basic tasks of spacefaring. The GM sets 
               DCs for the specialized tasks.
               <b>Retry: </b>An attempt to use a Profession skill to earn an income can't be retired. You're 
               stuck with whatever wage for the coming week your check result brought you. (Another check amy 
               be made after a week to determine a new income for the next period of time.)<br>

               ranks in Profession (Computer programmer) could get a =2 synergy bonus when making a Computer

               Use this skill to tell when someone is bluffing you. This skill represents sensitivity to the 
               body language, speed, habits, and mannerisms of others.<br>
               <b>Check: </b>A successful check allows you to avoid being bluffed (see the: Bluff skill). You 
               can also use the skill to tell when someone is behaving oddly or to assess someone's 
               trustworthiness.<br>
               In addition. you can use this skill Lo make a gut assessment of a social situation. You can get 
               the feeling from another's behavior that something is wrong. such as when you're talking to an 
               impostor. Alternatively, you can get the feeling that someone is trustworthy and honorable. The 
               DC for such a hunch is 20.<br>
               <i>Combat Readiness: </i>You get a good idea of an opponent's general combat skill. This use of 
               the skill requires you to spend a minimum of 3 rounds observing an opponent who is engaged in 
               combat. You can take no other actions in that time other than moving your normal movement rate. 
               You must keep your subject in view at all times. The DC is 20 + 1 for every character level 
               your opponent has attained. lf successful, you gain a +4 bonus on your first attack roll 
               against the observed opponent. This attack must come within 24 hours of the observation, or the 
               bonus is lost. You cannot gain this bonus against the same opponent twice unless the 
               character's level changed since you last observed him. When using this ability in a vehicle or 
               starship combat, the DC of the check is 20 + the character level of the vehicle's or starship"s 
               commander. <br>
               <i>Discern Strategy: </i>You can assess a combat situation and determine its true purpose. 
               Using this ability is a full-round action. The DC is 15 + 1 for every opponent you face. If 
               successful, you determine your opponents' true motive (distract you, delay you, or simply 
               destroy you). When using this ability in a vehicle or starship combat, the DC is 15 + 1 for 
               every vehicle or ship you face. (A starfighter wing counts as one ship for this purpose.)<br>

               You can lift a purse and hide it on your person. palm an unattended object. or perform some 
               feat of adroitness wilh an object no larger than a hat or a loaf of bread.<br>
               <b>Check: </b>A check against DC 10 lets you palm a coin-sized unattended object. Minor feats 
               of sleight of hand. such as making a coin disappear, are also DC 10 unless an observer is 
               concentrating on noticing where the item went.<br>
               When performing this skill under close observation. your skill check is opposed by the 
               observer's Spot check. The observer's check doesn't prevent you from performing thr action, 
               just from doing it unnoticed.<br>
               When you try to take something from another person, your opponent makes a Spot check to detect 
               the attempt. To attain the item, you must get a result of 20 or higher, regardless of the 
               opponent's check result. The opponent detects the attempt if her check result beats your check 
               result, whether or not you take the item.<br>
               <i>Drop: </i>You can also use Sleight of 1-land to place an object on someone without their 
               knowledgr, or to release an item without anyone noticing (such as putting a blaster on a table 
               under a napkin, or putting a sedative into someone's drink). The target makes a Spot check to 
               detect the attempt. To drop the item. you must get a check result of 20 or higher, regardless 
               of the opponent's check result. The opponent detects the drop attempt if his check result beats 
               your check result, whether or not you drop the item. <br>
               <i>Conceal Weapon or Item: </i>This application of the Sleight of Hand skill can be performed 
               untrained. It allows you to conceal a Medium-size or smaller weapon, or any other item of 
               similar size (such as a datapad or code cylinder), on your body. To conceal a weapon or other 
               object, make a Sleight of Hand check. lf you are not rushed or under unusual constraints, you 
               may take 10. The object's size applies a modifier to the check result: Fine + 12. Diminutive 
               +8. Tiny +4. Small +O, Medium-size -4.<br> Other charactes may casually notice a concealed 
               weapon with a successful Spot check (DC = the Sleight of Hand check result). Characters 
               actively searching for concealed weapons make a Search check instead, with a +4 circumstance 
               bonus for the hands-on act of frisking the target. <br>
               <b>Retry: </b>A second Sleight of Hand attempt against the same target, or when being watche 
               dby the same observer, has a DC 10 higher than the first skill check if hte first check failed 
               or if the attempt was noticed. <br>

               fail, you make no progress through the water. If you fail

               <i>Long-Term Care: </i>Some injuries require treatment that stretches over a number of days. 
               The successful application of this skill allows a patient to recover wound points and ability 
               points lost to temporary damage at twice the normal rate (2 wound points or 2 ability points 
               restored per day, instead of the normal 1 per day). A new check is made each day; on a fialed 
               check, recovery occurs at the normal rate for that day of rest and care.<br>
               You can tend up to as many patients as you have ranks in the skill. You need medical supplies, 
               and the patients need to spend all their time resting. You need to devote at aleast 1 hour of 
               the day to each patient you are carring for.<br>
               <i>Treat Daze: </i>You can tend to a dazed character. As an attack action. a successful treat 
               Injury check removes the dazed condition from another chararter. You must have a medical kit to 
               treat a dazed character.<br>
               <i>Treat Disease: </i>You can tend to a diseased character. Every time the diseased character 
               makes a saving throw against disease effects (after the inilial contamination). You make a 
               Treat Injury check to help the character fend off secondary damage. The diseased character uses 
               your result instead of his own saving throw if your result is higher. <br>
               <i>Treat Knockout: </i>You can tend to a knocked-out character. As an attack action, a 
               successful Treat Injury check removes the knocked-out condition from another character. You 
               must have a medical kit to treat a knocked-out character. <br>
               <i>Treat Poison: </i>You can tend to a poisoned character. Every time the poisoned character 
               makes a saving throw against poison effects (after the initial introduction of the poison to 
               his or her system), you make a Treat Injury check to help the chararter avoid secondary damage. 
               The poisoned character uses your result instead of his own saing throw if your result is higher.
               <br>
               <i>Treat Stun: </i>You can tend to a stunned character. As an attack action, a successful Treat 
               Injury check removes the stunned condition from another character. You must have a medical kit 
               to treat a stunned character. <br>
               <i>Use Medical Kit: </i>Wilh a medical kit and a little skill you can keep a badly wounded 
               character from dying or restore vitality points. This check is an Attack action.<br>
               If a character has negative wound points and is losing wound points (at 1 per round. 1 per 
               hour. or 1 per day). you can stabilize the character. The character regains no wound points, 
               but he or she does stop losing them. A character can be stabilized as often as necessary.<br>
               If a character has lost vitality points. you can restore some of them by giving the character's 
               system a boost. A successful check restores a number of vitality points equal to the number of 
               ranks you possess in the skill. The number restored can never exceed the character's full 
               normal total vitality points. This application can only be used successfully on a character 
               once i 24-hour period. <br>
               <i>Use Medpac: </i>A medpac is a simple medical device that is applied to a wounded character 
               and activated. A medpac restores 1d2 wound points to any wounded character (up to the 
               characters full normal total of wound points) with a successful skill check as an attack 
               action. This application can only be used successfully on a character once in a 24- hour 
               period. <br>
               <i>Use Bacta Tank: </i>A Specialized medical tank filled with the miraculous liquid, bacta, 
               promtes rapid healing and acts as a powerful disinfectant. When a character is disabled or 
               dying, bacta tank treatment is the best way to restore wound points to such a greviously 
               injured being. With a successful Treat Injury check and a bacta tank, a character recovers 
               vitality points at a rate of 3 per level per hour, and wound points at a rate of 1 per hour. 
               So, over the course of a 12-hour bacta tank treatment, a character recovers up to 36 vitality 
               poitns and 12 wound points. <br>
               <i>*Diagnose: </i>You can assess the level of injury someone else has sustained-determining 
               whether the other person is dazed, knocked out, stunned, out of vitality points, poisoned, 
               diseased, and so on. The DC for this check is 10. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the GM 
               may decide that you have misdiagnosed the ailment, generally by assuming that it is less 
               serious than it appears. The GM should roll this check in secret. This check can also detennine 
               whether someone is alive or not.<br>
               <b>Special: </b>The surgery feat gives a character the extra training he or she needs to use 
               Treat Injury to help a wounded character recover faster by means of an operation. <br>
               <?php cant20("Treat Injury") ?>
               You can use the Treat Injury skill on yourself only if you are using a medical kit or a medpac. 
               In either case, you take a -5 penalty on your check.
               <b>Time: </b>Treat Injury checks take different amounts of time based on the task at hand, as 
               described above. <br>
