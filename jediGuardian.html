            <div class="ClassBoilerPlate">
                Force-users trained in the jedi tradition. jedi guardians combine physical training with 
                mastery of the Force. Jedi guardians concentrate on battle prowess, defense, lightsaber 
                training, and phyiscal activities. If Jedi consulars are the ambassadors the Jedi Order, 
                guardians are teh defenders protecting the Republic from all dangers. Few are strong enough in 
                the Force and have the devotion to walk the Jedi's path, but those few are awarded with 
                powerful ally. They walk in a larger world than those who neither feel or need the Force.
                <br><br>
                
                <b>Explolits</b><br>
                All jedi guardians journey into the galaxy at large to further their own knowledge and to help 
                thsoe in need. They take their responsiblity seriously, considering even mundane missions to 
                be personal tests. Most Jedi guardians follow the light side, but some become dark-siders and 
                use teh Force for evil or selfish intent. Those imbued with with the light side refrain from 
                using the Force for every task, preferring to find other solutions and save the Force for when 
                it is truly needed. Those who succumb to the dark side use every advantage at their disposal, 
                wielding the Force to solve problems as a soldier would use a blaster to destroy a stingly. 
                <br><br>

                <b>Characteristics</b><br>
                The Jedi guardian's strength flow from the Force, granting her special powers. This character 
                often masters the ability to feel the living Force in the world within her, as typified by the 
                Control feat. Constitution and Strength are the most important abilities for the Jedi 
                guardian, followed by Intelligence.<br><br>

                <b>Background</b><br>
                A jedi guardian typically starts out as a Padawan learner attached to a Jedi Master. (Prior to 
                1st level, the charcter trained as a student with the Jedi council, She begins her heroic 
                career at 1st level when she is slected as a Padawan learner.) The Jedi guardian has a genuine 
                desire to use the Force to help the people of the galaxy. A guardian has a deep connection to 
                her mentor and the Jedi Order but often oerpates with only tangential contact with either 
                master or order.<br><br>

            <b>Deflect (Defense)</b><br>
            A jedi learns to defelct blaster bolts and other projectiles with her lightsaber, therby 
            providinga  dodge bonus to Defense against such attacks. You must be carrying an activated 
            ligthsaber to use this special ability.<br>
            &emsp;Deflecting an attack is a reaction that costs the jedi a move action in her next round. The 
            jedi must indicate that she is using deflect (defense) when an opponent declares an attack against 
            her but before any attack rolls are made. When used in this fashion, the Jedi gains the dodge 
            bonus against all ranged attacks directed at her in the round.<br>
            &emsp;For example, if Sia-Lan Wezz uses her activated lightsaber to deflect any number of blaster 
            attacks in round two of combat, in round three Sia-Lan loses a move action to account for the 
            effort expended to deflect teh attacks in round two.<br>
            &emsp;Each tim the Jedi gains deflect (defense), it provides a +1 dodg ebonus to Defense when she 
            uses her lightsaber to block ranged attacks. So, at 1st level the dodge bonus to Defense is +1, at 
            9th level it increases to a +2 at 13th level it increases to +3, and at 17th level it increases to 
            +4.<br>
            &emsp;Deflect (defense) can be used in conjunction with total defense for even greater protection, 
            providing the dodge bonus for deflecting the attack and the +4 dodg ebonus granted by using total 
            defense. In this case, deflect (defense isn't a reaction; it's an attack action used in a round 
            when the jedi expects to come under heavy fire.<br><br>

            <b>Bonus Feats</b><br>
            At 2nd, 8th, 12th, and 18th level, the Jedi guardian gains a bonu feat. This feat must be selected 
            from the following list, and the Jedi guardian must meet any prerequisites.<br>
            <uL>

            <b>Deflect (Attack)</b><br>
            A jedi learns to deflect blaster bolts with her lightsaber, redirecting attack towards the target 
            within one range increment o the Jedi's position. (The type of blaster determiines the range 
            increment.) You must be carrying an activated ligthsaber to use this special ability.<br>
            &emsp;Deflectinga nd redirecting an attack is a reaction that costs the Jedi a move action in her 
            next round. The Jedi must indicate that she is using deflect (attack) when an opponent declares an 
            attack against her but before any attack rolls are made. Deflect (defense) and deflect (attack) 
            can be used together in the same round (though the jedi can decdie not to use the defense if she 
            wants a better chacne at redirecting the incoming attack).<br>
            &emsp;The Jedi can defelct and redirect a number of attacks equal to one-half her Jedi level, 
            rounded up. The redirected attack must miss the Jedi by 5 or less; any attack that hits the Jedi 
            or misses by 6 or more points can't be redirected.<br>
            &emsp;If the Jedi can redirect the attack, the Jedi immediately rolls an attack using her 
            lighsaber attack bonus and applying a -4 penalty as described below. If this roll is high enough 
            to hit the target, the redirected attack deals damage to the target (the type of blaster 
            determines the damage dealt by a redirected attack).<br>
            &emsp;Each time the jedi gains deflect (attack), the penalty associated witht he redirectd attack 
            is lessened by 1. So, at 3rd level the penalty is -4, at 11th level -3, at 16th level -2, and at 
            19th level -1.<br><br>

            <b>Increased Lightsaber damage</b><br>
            As a jedi guardian gains levels, the amount of damage she can eeal with her lightsaber increases.
            <br>
            &emsp;Each time the Jedi gains increase ligthsaber damage, the weapon's damage increases by +1d8. 
            So, at 5th level her lightsaber deals 3d8, at 10th level it deals 4d8, at 15th level it deals 5d8, 
            and at 20th level it deals 6d8 points of damage.<br><br>

            <b>Deflect (Extended Defense and Attack)</b><br>
            At 6th level, a jedi guardian learns to extend her defensive and offensive deflection skills to 
            others within 2 meters of the Jedi's position. You must be carrying an activated lightsaber to use 
            this special ability.<br>
            &emsp;Now the jedi can provide a dodge bonus to anyone within 2 meters of his posiiton, and hec an 
            deflect and redirect ranged attacks made against anyone within 2 meters of her position. All ruels 
            associated with deflect (defense) and deflect (attack) apply; the only difference is now the Jedi 
            can extend this ability to help those nearby.<br><br>

            <b>Jedi Knight</b><br>
            At 7th level, the Jedi guardian graduates from Padawan learner to Jedi Knight and gets a bonus 
            knight feat. This bonus knight feat must be drawn from teh following list, and the Jedi guardian 
            must meet an prerequisites.
            <ul>
                <li>Burst of Speed</li>
                <li>Knight Speed</li>
                <li>Dissipate Energy</li>
                <li>Lightsaber Defense</li>
                <li>Knight Defense</li>
                <li>Force Mastery</li>
                <li>Force Mind</li>
                <li>Knight Mind</li>
                <li>Weapon Focus (lightsaber)</li>
            </ul><br><br>

            <b>Block</b><br>
            This is modified version of deflect (defense) that allows the Jedi to defelct a ranged attack 
            without the use of a lightsaber. The Jedi must have some form of protective gear (such as armored 
            gauntlets) or an item taht cna withstand the ranged attack. The dodge bonus provided by deflect 
            (defense) is used when a jedi blocks a ranged attack without a lightsaber. Block doesn't allow a 
            jedi to redirect the attack or to extend the defense beyond the Jedi's position, and all other 
            rules concerning deflect (defense) apply.<br><br>
