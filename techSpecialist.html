            <b>Skill Emphasis</b><br>
            At 1st level, the tech specialist gains the Skill Emphasis feat. This feat must be applied to a 
            skill form the following list, thus setting the direction for your tech specialty<br>
            Computer Use, Craft (select one), Treat Injury, 
            Repair.<br><br>

            <b>Research</b><br>
            The tech specialist has a knack for finding technical information of all types. Starting at 2nd 
            level, he gets to add his tech specialist level to any knowledge check whenever he searches 
            through databaes and other sources when seeking technical information<br><br>

            <b>Instant Mastery</b><br>
            At 3rd and 16th level, the tech specialist gains 4 ranks in any Intelligence-based skill (including cross-class skills, but not Force skills) that he currently has not ranks in.<br><br>

            <b>Tech Specialty</b><br>
            At 4th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 19th level, the tech specialist gains a tech specialty. Each 
            time, the tech specialist selects a specialty form among the hose descibed below. It can be a 
            different specialty each time, or the tech specialist can choose the same specialty as many as 
            three times over the course of the six selections.<br>
            &emsp;<i>Computer Specialist:</i>Recive a +1 bonus on Computer Use checks. 
            Addition selections of this tech specialty can improve the bonus to +2 and +3.<br>
            &emsp;<i>Mastercrafter:</i>Applying this specialty to a specific Craft skill 
            allows you to build mastercraft items using that skill. The types of items that can be 
            mastercrafted, and the relevant Craft skill for each type, are as follows.<br>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Weapons</td>
                    <td>Craft (specific weapon group)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Armor</td>
                    <td>Craft (armor)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Datapad</td>
                    <td>Craft (electronic devices)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Medpac</td>
                    <td>Craft (medpacs)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Security kit</td>
                    <td>Craft (electronic devices)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Sensor pack</td>
                    <td>Craft (electronic devices)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            On average, it takes twice as long to construct a mastercraft item as it does to create an 
            ordinary item of the same sort: You must pay double the cost for raw materials (2/3 of the item's 
            normal price rather than 1/3), and the result of every daily Craft check you make 
            is halved (round down). You can add the mastercraft feature to an existing ordinary item by paying 
            the raw material cost and then making daily Craft checks as though you were 
            constructing the item itself.<br>
            &emsp;In addition to the cost of raw materials, the tech specialist also must pay a number of 
            experience poitns equal to one-half the price of an ordinary item (for instance, 250 XP for a 
            blaster pistol priced at 500 credits). These experience poitns must be paid along the raw 
            materials cost, before the character makes any daily Craft checks to create the 
            mastercraft item. If the expenditure of these XP would drop the character's total to below the 
            minimum needed for his or her current level, thent he XP cannot be paid (and the mastercraft work 
            cannot be begun) until the character gains enough additiona XP to remain at hsi current level 
            after the expenditure is made.<br>
            &emsp;Creating a mastercraft item is a task of exterme complexity; as such, the DC of the final Craft check to complete the item is 20.<br>
            &emsp;When successfully completed, ta mastercraft item provides a +1 bonus to the quality of an 
            ordinary item of the same type. For more infomraiton, see Mastercraft Items on page 136 of the 
            core book.<br>
            &emsp;Additional selections of this tech specialty can give a character the ability to make items 
            with a +2 and the +3 bonuses. To make a +2 item, a tech specialist needs to start with a +1 item, 
            paying the monetary and XP costs appropriate to that item. Similarly, to make a +3 item, the 
            cahracter needs to start with a +2 item.<br>
            &emsp;<i>Mechanic: </i>Recieve a +1 bonus on Repair checks. Additional selections 
            of this tech specialty can improve the bonus to +2 and +3.<br>
            &emsp;<i>Medical Specialist:</i>Recieve a +1 bonus on Treat Injury checks. 
            Additional selections of this tech specialty can improve the bonus to +2 and +3.<br>
            &emsp;<i>Surgical Specialist:</i>Improve the number of wounds you can restore using the Treat Injury skill and the Surgery by +1. Additional selections of this tech 
            specialty can improve the number of wounds restored to +2 and +3.
            <br><br>

            <b>Expert</b><br>
            At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, the tech specialist selects a specific Craft, 
            Knowledge, or Profession skill. Each time, he must select a 
            different skill. For example, a tech specialist might select Craft (blaster 
            pistols and rifles) at 5th level, Profession (weaponsmith) at 10th level, and knowledge (engineering) at 15th level.<br>
            &emsp;You recieve a +2 expert bonus on checks made using the selected skill. Note that expert bonuses do not stack.<br><br>
