            <h1>Scoundrel</h1>
            <div class="ClassBoilerPlate">
                Scoundrels are rogues-good, bad, and neutral-who either live outside the law or fight against 
                it in order to get the upper hand. They can come from any world or region of the galaxy. Most 
                use their intelligence and dexterity to accomplish tasks, and many rely on charisma as a 
                fallback when all else falls. The scoundrel gets by with bravado, cunning, duplicity, and 
                trickery. They live by their wits, lying, cheating, stealing, and even fighting when teh need 
                arises.<br><br>
                
                <b>Explolits</b><br>
                Many scoundrels live a life of of adventure for the excitement it rpovides. Others go 
                adventuring to advance their illicit careers. Some are good-hearted rogues in it for the 
                thrill or to right a wrong done to them or those they love. Others are despicable knaves who 
                serve only one master- the gree that swells inside them. More often, a adventurous scoundrel 
                falls somewhere int eh dmiddle, changing allegiance and attitudes as the political climate 
                changes, until something larger than himself sets him on a particular course through the 
                galaxy. Adventurous scoundrels call themselves smugglers, pirates, outlaws, gamblers, slicers, 
                con artists, thieves, rogues, and spies.<br><br>

                <b>Characteristics</b><br>
                Scoundrels have a knack for getting into and out of trouble. They have an instinct for 
                self-preservation that keeps them alive, but it's usually tempered with a need to experience 
                the thrills that their porfession has to offer,and many adventurous scoundrels are also 
                saddled with a sense of honor that sometimes makes them go against their natural inclinations.
                <br><br>

                <b>Background</b><br>
                Scoundrels don't often start out seeking to defy authority and break the law. Some are thrust 
                into the profession as a means of rebellion. others wind up on the wrong side of hte law due 
                to bad luck, poor decisions, or cirumstances beyond their control. The skills they pick upa 
                long the way make them great members of any mission team.<br><br>
