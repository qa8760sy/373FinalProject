                Characters spend a lot of time getting from one place to another. The Gm moderates the pace of 
                a game session, so he or shee determines when movement is so important that it's worth 
                measuring. During casual scenes, you usually won' thave to worry about movement rates. If your 
                character arrives at a new spaceport and takes a stroll to get a feel for the place, no one 
                needs ot know exaclty how many rounds or minutes the circuit takes.<br>
                &emsp;There are four movement scales in the game:
                <ul>
                    <li>Tactical, for combat, measured in meters per round.</li>
                    <li>Local, for exploring an area, measured in meters per minute</li>
                    <li>Overland, for getting from place to place on a planet, measured in kilometers per hour 
                        or day.</li>
                    <li>Space, for getting from planet to planet, measured in light-years per hour or day.</li>
                </ul>
                <b id="modesofmovement">Modes of Movement</b><br>
                While moving at the different movement scales, characters generally walk, hustle, or run.<br>
                &emsp;<b>Walk: </b>A walk represents unhurried but purposeful movement at five kilometers per 
                hour for an uncencumbered Human.<br>
                &emsp;<b>Hustle: </b>A hustle is a jog covering about ten kilometers per hour for an 
                unencumbered Human. Taking two move actions in a round represents a hustle.<br>
                &emsp;<b>Run(x3): </b> Moving three times your normal speed is a running pace fo ra character 
                in heavy armor. Run is a full-round aciton, and running characters lose their Dexterity bonus 
                to Defense (if any).<br>
                &emsp;<b>Run(x4): </b>Moving four times your normal speed is a running pace for a character in 
                light, medium, or no armor. Run is a full-round action, and running characters lose their 
                Dexterity bonus to Defense (if any).

                <b id="hamperedmovement">Hampered Movement</b><br>
                Obstructions, bad surface conditions, or poor visibility can hamper movement. The Gm 
                determines the category that a specific condition falls into. When movement is hapered, 
                multiply the standard distance by the movement penalty (a fract) to determine the distance 
                covered. For example, a character who could normally cover 20 meteres with a double move 
                (hustle) can only cover 10 meters if moving through undergrowth.<br>
                &emsp;If more than one condition applies, multiply the normal distance covered by all movement 
                penalty fractions that apply. For instance, a character who could normally cover 20 meters 
                with double move (hustle) could only cover 5 meters moving through thick undergrowth in fog 
                (one quarter as far as normal).

                <b id="tacticalmovement">Tactical Movement</b><br>
                Characters generally don't walk during combat - they hustle or run. A character who moves his 
                or her speed and takes some action, such as attacking, is hustling fo about half the round and 
                doing something else the other half.<br><br>
                <b id="localmovement">Local Movement</b><br>
                Characters exploring an area use local movement, measured in minutes.<br>
                &emsp;<b>Walk: </b>A character can walk without a problem on the local scale.<br>
                &emsp;<b>Hustle: </b>A character can hustle without a problem on the local scale. See Overland 
                Movement, below, for movement measured in hours.<br>
                &emsp;<b>Run: </b>A character with a Constitution score of 9 or higher can run for a minute 
                without a problem. Generally, a character can run for about  minute or two before having to 
                rest for a minute.<br><br>
                <b id="overlandmovement">Overland Movement</b><br>
                Characters covering long distances cross-country use over-land movement. Overland movement is 
                measured in hours or days. A day represents 8 hours of actualy travel time. For vehicles, it 
                represents a full 24hours. (If a vehicle isn't operated for a full 24 hours, multiply the 
                distance fraction of the day the vehicle was moving.)<br>
                &emsp;In general, each meter per round in tactical speed equaes to half a kilometer per hour 
                in overland speed. Thus, a character with a speed of 10 meters walks 5 kilometers in an 8-hour 
                day, while a landspeeder (with a speed of 400) can travel 4,800 kilometers per 24 hours of 
                travel.<br>
                &emsp;<b>Walk: </b>A character can walk 8 hours in a day of travel without a problem. Walking 
                farther than that can wear you out (see Forced March, below).<br>
                &emsp;<b>Hustle: </b>A character can hustle for 1 hour without a problem. Hustling a second 
                hour in between sleep cycles causes the character to lose 1 vitality point, and each 
                additional hour causes twice the damage taken during the previous hour.<br>
                &emsp;<b>Run: </b>A character can't run for an extended period of time. Attempts to runa nd 
                rest in cycles effectively work out to a hustle.<br>
                &emsp;<b>Terrain: </b>The terrain through which a character travels affects how much distance 
                he or she can cover in an hour or day. Travel is quickest on a highway, somewhat less quck on 
                a raod or trail, and least quiick through trackless terrain. A highway is a straight, major, 
                paved road. A road is typically a narrow highway. A trail is a dirt track that allows only

                &emsp;<b>Forced March: </b>in a day of normal walking, a character walks for 8 hours. He or 
                she spends the rest of the daylight time making and breaking camp, resting and eating.<br>
                &emsp;A character can walk for more than 8 hours in a day by making a forced march. For each 
                hour of marching beyond eight hours, the character makes a Constitution check (DC 10 + 1 per 
                extra hour). If the check fials, the character loses 1d6 vitality points. The character can't 
                recover this damage normally until he or she halts and rests for at least 4 hours. It's 
                possible for a character to march into unconsciousness by pushing too hard.<br>

            <div id="encumbrance"><h4>Encumbrance</h4>
                Encumbrance rules determine how much a charater's equipment slows him or her down. Encumbrance 
                comes in two parts: encumbrance by armor and encumbrance by total weight. Bear in mind, we 
                don't see a lot of edvidence in the Star Wars movies of characters carrying loads of equipment 
                or wearing tons of armor. It just isn't done. More often, extra equipment is stored in a ship 
                and retrieved when needed.<br>
                <b>Encumbrance by Armor</b><br>
                Your armor defines your maximum Dexterity bonus to Defense, your 
                armor check penalty, your speed, and how fast you move when you run. Unless your character is 
                weak or carrying a lot of gear that's all you need to know. The extra gear your character 
                carries, such as weapons and medpacs, won't slow your character down any more than his or her 
                armor already does.<br>
                &emsp;If your character is weak or carrying a really heavy load, however, then you'll need to 
                calculate encumbrance by weigh. Doing so is most important when your character is trying to 
                carry some heavy object, such as a pack full of survival gear or an unconscious comrade.<br><br>
                <b>Weight</b><br>
                If you want to determine whether your character's gear is heavy enough to slow him or her down 
                (more than any armor already does). add up the weight of all the armor, weapons, and gear the 
                character is carrying. Compare this total to the character's Strength on the table below. 
                Depending on how the weight compares to your carrying capacity, you will be carryin a light, 
                medium, or heavy load. Like armor, your load gives you a maximum Dexterity bonus to Defense, a 
                check penalty (which works like an armor check penalty), speed, and run factor, as shown on 
                the table. Carrying a light load does nto encumber a character.<br>
                &emsp;If you are wearing armor, use the worse figure(from the armor or from weight) for each 
                category. Do not stack the penalties.<br><br>
                <b>Lifting and Dragging</b>
                A character can lit up to the heavy load weight over his or her head.<br>
                &emsp;A character can lift up to double the heavy load weight off the ground, but he or she 
                can only stagger around with it. While overloaded in this way, the character loses any 
                Dexterity bonus to Defense and can only move 2 meters per round (as a full-round action).<br>
                &emsp;A character can generally push or drag along the ground up to five times the heavy load 
                weight. Favorable conditions (smooth ground, draggin a slick object) can double these numbers, 
                and unfavorable conditions (broken ground, pushing an object that snags) can reduce them to 
                one-half or less.<br><br>
                <b>Bigger and Smaller Creatures</b><br>
                The figure son carrying capactiy are for Medium-size creatures. Larger creatures can carry 
                more weight depending on size category: Large (x2), Huge(x4), Gargantuan(x8), and Colossal 
                (x16). Smaller creatures can carry less weight depending on size category: Small (3/4), Tiny(1/
                2), and Diminutive (1/4).<br><br>
                <b>Tremendous Strength</b><br>
                For Strength scores not listed, determine the carrying capacity this way: Find the Strength 
                score between 20 and 29 that has the same one digit as the creatre's Strength score. Multiply 
                the figures by four if the creature's Strength is in the 30s, 16 if it's in the 40s, 64 if 
                it's in the 50s, and so on.

                Most major systems have regular comings and going of such
                ships. with accommodations ranging from meager to luxurious.
                Short trip may be pricced on a per-day basis. while a flat

            <div id="charteringastarship"><h4>Charting a Starship</h4>
                If all else fails, hire someone to fly you where you want to go. This is the most expensive 
                form of starship travel, with character costs starting int eh thousands of credits and going 
                up from there.<br>
                A charcter has one enormous advantage over booking passage: privacy. Whether you're smuggling 
                illegal cargo or you just wish to avoid Imperial entanglements, private charter is the best 
                way to go. To reach some remote systems, it might also be the only way to go.<br>
                In gernal, the captain of a private charter negotiates a price based on the number of 
                passengers, the type of cargo, the distance traveled, and how dangerous the journey might be. 
                A base price of 6,000 credits gives the average charter captain a place to start. Han Solo 
                offered a price of 10,000 credits to get an old man, a boy, and and a pair of droids from 
                Tatooine to Alderaan while avoiding Imperials. The GM is encouraged to negotiate in good faith 
                if the heroes decide to go this route (unless, of course the captain they hook up with isn't a 
                good-faith type of person).

                    <b>Astrogation</b><br>
                    <i>Trained Only</i><br>
                    Use this skill to plot a course through hyperspace from one star system to another.<br>
                    <b>Check: </b>You can plot a safe course through hyperspace between two star systems. The 
                    result of an Astrogate check determines whether a particular trip occurs without incident 
                    and how much time the trip takes; a failed check indicates either a delayed journey or the 
                    possibility of a hyperspace mishap that can ruin the journey. For information on moving 
                    through hyperspace, see Astrogation on page 205 in Chapter Eleven: Starships.<br>
                    You can also use this skill to determine your position in space without the use of a nav 
                    computer by checking the constellations-provided you are traveling through an area of 
                    space  you are Familiar wilh.<br>
                    <b>Special: </b>You can take 10 when making an Astrogate Check, but you can't take 20 
                    since there is a possible penalty for frailing.<br>
                    A character with the <?=feat("Spacer")?> Feat and at least 1 rank in this skill gets a +2 
                    aptitude bonus on Astrogate checks. <br>
                    <b>Time: </b>Astrogating a course takes 1 minute. <br>
